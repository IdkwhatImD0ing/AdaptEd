      "Page: Stack (abstract data type)\n",
      "Summary: In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements with two main operations:\n",
      "\n",
      "Push, which adds an element to the collection, and\n",
      "Pop, which removes the most recently added element.Additionally, a peek operation can, without modifying the stack, return the value of the last element added. The name stack is an analogy to a set of physical items stacked one atop another, such as a stack of plates. \n",
      "The order in which an element added to or removed from a stack is described as last in, first out, referred to by the acronym LIFO. As with a stack of physical objects, this structure makes it easy to take an item off the top of the stack, but accessing a datum deeper in the stack may require removing multiple other items first.Considered a linear data structure, or more abstractly a sequential collection, a stack has one end which is the only position at which the push and pop operations may occur, the top of the stack, and is fixed at the other end, the bottom. This data structure makes it possible to implement a stack as a singly linked list and as a pointer to the top element. A stack may be implemented to have a bounded capacity. If the stack is full and does not contain enough space to accept another element, the stack is in a state of stack overflow.\n",
      "A stack is needed to implement depth-first search.\n",
      "\n",
      "Page: Stack-oriented programming\n",
      "Summary: Stack-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that relies on a stack (or multiple stacks) to manipulate data and/or pass parameters. Several programming languages fit this description, notably Forth, RPL, and PostScript. Stack-oriented programming languages operate on one or more stacks, each of which may serve a different purpose. Programming constructs in other programming languages need to be modified for use in a stack-oriented system. Most stack-oriented languages operate in postfix or Reverse Polish notation. Any arguments or parameters for a command are stated before that command. For example, postfix notation would be written 2, 3, multiply instead of multiply, 2, 3 (prefix or Polish notation), or 2 multiply 3 (infix notation). The programming languages Forth, Factor, RPL, PostScript, BibTeX style design language and many assembly languages fit this paradigm.\n",
      "Stack-based algorithms consider data, by utilising one piece of data from atop the stack, and returning data back atop the stack. The need for stack manipulation operators, allow for the stack to manipulate data. To emphasise the effect of a statement, a comment is used showing the top of the stack before and after the statement. This is known as the stack effect diagram. PostScript stacks consider separate stacks for additional purposes. This considers variables, dictionaries, procedures, anatomy of some typical procedures, control and flow. The analysis of the language model allows expressions and programs to be interpreted simply and theoretically.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Page: Reverse Polish notation\n",
      "Summary: Reverse Polish notation (RPN), also known as reverse Łukasiewicz notation, Polish postfix notation or simply postfix notation, is a mathematical notation in which operators follow their operands, in contrast to prefix or Polish notation (PN), in which operators precede their operands. The notation does not need any parentheses for as long as each operator has a fixed number of operands.\n",
      "The term postfix notation describes the general scheme in mathematics and computer sciences, whereas the term reverse Polish notation typically refers specifically to the method used to enter calculations into hardware or software calculators, which often have additional side effects and implications depending on the actual implementation involving a  stack. The description \"Polish\" refers to the nationality of logician Jan Łukasiewicz, who invented Polish notation in 1924.The first computer to use postfix notation, though it long remained essentially unknown outside\n"
