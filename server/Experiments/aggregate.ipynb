Compared to other self-balancing binary search trees, the nodes in a red-black tree hold an extra bit called \"color\" representing \"red\" and \"black\" which is used when re-organising the tree to ensure that it is always approximately balanced.\n",
      "When the tree is modified, the new tree is rearranged and \"repainted\" to restore the coloring properties that constrain how unbalanced the tree can become in the worst case. The properties are designed such that this rearranging and recoloring can be performed efficiently.\n",

The time complexity of operations on the binary search tree is linear with respect to the height of the tree.\n",
      "Binary search trees allow binary search for fast lookup, addition, and removal of data items. Since the nodes in a BST are laid out so that each comparison skips about half of the remaining tree, the lookup performance is proportional to that of binary logarithm. BSTs were devised in the 1960s for the problem of efficient storage of labeled data and are attributed to Conway Berners-Lee and David Wheeler.\n",
      "The performance of a binary search tree is dependent on the order of insertion of the nodes into the tree since arbitrary insertions may lead to degeneracy; several variations of the binary search tree can be built with guaranteed worst-case performance. The basic operations include: search, traversal, insert and delete. BSTs with guaranteed worst-case complexities perform better than an unsorted array, which would require linear search time.\n",
      "The complexity analysis of BST shows that, on average, the insert, delete and search takes O(log⁡n){\\displaystyle O(\\log n)} for n{\\displaystyle n} nodes. In the worst case, they degrade to that of a singly linked list: O(n){\\displaystyle O(n)}. To address the boundless increase of the tree height with arbitrary insertions and deletions, self-balancing variants of BSTs are introduced to bound the worst lookup complexity to that of the binary logarithm. AVL trees were the first self-balancing binary search trees, invented in 1962 by Georgy Adelson-Velsky and Evgenii Landis.\n",
